*YOU MUST COPY THE CODE FROM THE FILE CALLED "YOLO" IF YOU WANT TO USE THE CODE*

*THE VIDEO IS TOO BIG TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB, SO MUST CREATE YOUR OWN PRE-RECORDER VIDEO, THE IMAGE HOWEVER CAN BE FOUND IN THE FOLDERS*
*YOU MAY HAVE TO DOWLOAD CUDA BEOFRE HAND, THE GITHUB CLONING USED IN THIS WORK SHOULD ALSO WORK IN YOUR IDE*
